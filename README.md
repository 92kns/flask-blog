# Flask Blog with Docker
Simple CRUD Flask app based off of the quickstart/tutorial from Flask. This has been taken a bit further by Dockerizing it.
If for some reason someone is reading this here is how you can immediately start playing with the web app on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). Clone the repo and run the following in a terminal

```sh
docker-compose up
```

then go to the localhost above or whatever one you may have modified it to.

At the moment it is using development server but that will change when I get around to hosting it... at which point I am thinking of making this a mini-tutorial/extension!
